        <h1>What is meal planning?</h1>
        <p>Meal planning is the act of arranging and selecting your meals for a certain length of time, 
            usually a week, in advance. It entails choosing recipes, figuring out portion sizes, and making sure your intake of nutrients is balanced and in line with your dietary requirements and health objectives. 
            Meal preparation in advance allows you to make healthier decisions, cut down on food waste, 
            and resist the temptation to go for convenience items that aren't as nutrient-dense. 
            Budgeting is aided by meal planning as well, since it enables you to make a thorough shopping list and only purchase what you need,
            thereby saving money. Meal planning is a useful tactic for keeping a healthy and well-organized lifestyle, whether it's for weight control, 
            special dietary needs, or just to simplify everyday activities. </p>
